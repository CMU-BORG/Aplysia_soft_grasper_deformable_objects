    "We the test time history dependent control on an open loop controller and a closed loop controller (v2): Without neuromodulation, the open loop controller can only send a fixed jaw positIon during grasper closing phases. Time history dependent controLler can modulate the jaw position commands so that the grasper can generate higher contact forces if the first pick attempt fails. For the closed loop controller, time history dependent controLler modulates the <s>jaw pressure commands</s> force thresholds.    \n",
    "\n",
    "How to make the grasper fail on the first attempt: In the simulation, we use a quite heavy object (1 kg) to increase the difficulty of the task. The initial maximal jaw command of the open loop controller is set to a value lower than 0.1. This prevents the grasper from establishing strong contact with the object at the beginning. We also use a small force threshold so that the controller start picking the object up even with small contact forces. The low force threshold can be achieved by either setting a small force threshold gain for the perceptor, or using perceptor_modulation. perceptor_modulation is a special SNS that has no inhibitory synapses from the grasping-the-object command neuron to the lifting-the-object-up command neuron. Controller using this SNS tends to lift the object up earlier."
